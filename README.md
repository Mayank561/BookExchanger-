BookExchanger is a website where a person can buy or sell his books. Every year we see that if a student want to buy second-hand books he has to ask everyone whether they have book or not. Similarly, if a person wants to sell his old books he has to ask everyone and search for buyers. So we try to create a platform where a person can buy or sell his second-hand books without any diffculty. so we try to make a BookExchanger website with almost all the features which can resolve all the problems the buyers or sellers face while buying or selling a book.
